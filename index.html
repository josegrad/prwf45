<p>I have a friend who teaches a grade six class. Yesterday she began explaining how the moonlight is really just light reflected from the sun, when the whole class erupted into a volcano of curiosity. She couldn’t keep up with all the great questions they were asking, and had them write them all down. She shared some of them with me, and I thought I’d take a stab at answering them.</p>
<h3>“What are planets for?”</h3>
<p>Well… planets aren’t really for anything at all. They have no purpose. No particular reason for floating around space. When we look at the barren desert of Mars, or the thick clouds of Venus it’s easy to consider our lovely little earth to be a paradise. I think it’s important to realize that there is nothing special about earth. It formed out of chaos and clouds of dust just as randomly as any other planet in our system.</p>
<p>As for why earth has such a lush ecosystem compared to Mars’ red dust… I suppose it’s a bit like baking a cake. When the ingredients are mixed just right, the cake will rise up light and fluffy. If the recipe is too far off, you end up with a dried out lump of floury gunk. If you were mixing cake ingredients in the same crazy way that the planets were formed, throwing them all around and seeing which bowls they landed in, you’d end up with way more lumps of gunk than you would delicious cakes. It doesn’t make that one cake special… it just happened to work out alright.</p>
<h3>“How big exactly was the big bang if it is not a theory and it is real?”</h3>
<p>The first thing to talk about here is what scientists mean when they call something a “theory”. Sir Isaac Newton discovered his “Theory of Gravity”, but if you drop a rock on your toe it sure does feel real! A theory is another way of saying “I’m pretty sure I know how this works”. Scientists always like to say they are “pretty sure” instead of saying “I absolutely 100% know this is true”. The reason they do that is because other scientists will always be discovering new things that might change our understanding of something. There is always room for improvement and refinement in science.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Big Bang, it’s always been a challenge for astronomers to see what happened so long ago… 13.7 billion years back! It’s a bit like trying to do a jigsaw puzzle when all the pieces have been hidden all over your city. First you have to find the pieces, then you need to fit them together… and all the while you don’t know what the puzzle is supposed to look like!</p>
<p>Now back to the question… how big was the Big Bang? Well, I suppose you could say it was the biggest thing ever. Everything everywhere… planets, stars, galaxies… was all compressed into one little ball and then it exploded. It exploded so big it spread all the pieces (including you and me) all over the universe, which is almost too big to even imagine. It had more energy than our sun and all the stars in the sky. HUGE energy! ALL energy at once!</p>
<p>“Big” doesn’t even begin to explain it.</p>
<h3>“How did people get on Earth?”</h3>
<p>This is a bit like asking how you got to the town in which you were born. You never really moved there. You just started there from your beginning. Maybe your parents moved to that town from somewhere else. Or maybe it was your grandparents that first arrived. To find out how humans got here we need to go way back. Way way back. All the way back to that Big Bang thing.</p>
<p>You see, you and I are made up of tiny parts, atoms, just like everything else. At one point all these atoms were part of that Big Bang. Hydrogen and helium atoms were thrown across the universe, and they started combining and mixing into more complex things like carbon and oxygen. If we fast forward about 10 billion years, the cloud of dust, made up of those same original atoms, begins forming into the ball we lovingly call Earth. Fast forward another 2 billion years and some of those atoms just so happened to “bake a cake” and rise up as the first single-celled organisms. A living thing on an otherwise dead rocky planet.</p>
<p>Jump ahead 4 billion years and those single cells have fought and clawed their way (or, at least once they grew claws) to grow into animals and plants. It’s always just a new way of arranging those atoms. Some of those animals became dinosaurs about 300 million years ago. Other animals became mammals somewhat like a mole. Those mammals kept adapting and changing over the millions of years until about 25 thousand years ago our ancestors popped up in the mix. Those early humans kept on growing, becoming smarter and stronger, until… well… here we are.</p>
<p>So we never got here. The stuff that we’re made of has always been here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stay tuned for more great questions next time.</p>

<p>The brightest star that we can see in the night sky has been named <strong>Sirius</strong>, an ancient Greek word for <em>“glowing”</em>. It’s one of the closest stars to earth, about <strong>8.5 light years</strong> away, and we can look forward to it getting brighter for the next 60,000 years as it inches ever closer to us. When the conditions are right, this star can be seen even in daylight.</p>
<p>It was in 1844, however, when this bright pinpoint of light was determined to be a <strong>binary star</strong>. That means the light we see is, in fact, produced by a pair of burning gas balls so close together that it seems as one. <strong>Sirius A</strong> is a big bright star, while <strong>Sirius B</strong> is a tiny <strong>white dwarf</strong>, which is a late stage star that has nearly burnt out and collapsed into a super dense ball. A teaspoon of white dwarf star material would weigh about the same as a locomotive.</p>
<p>The two make up a binary star system because they orbit around each other at about the same distance as <strong>Uranus</strong> orbits around the <strong>Sun</strong>. That’s close enough to be tangled up in each others gravitational fields. Some binary stars are so close that they actually pull on the gas like the moon pulls on the ocean tides. Matter is ripped free of it’s gravitational bonds creating a stream of “star juice” between the two masses.</p>
<p>Thanks to <strong>Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion</strong> physicists have been able to look at the orbits of binary stars, which from our viewpoint is little more than a wobble, and reverse engineer the precise details of their mass and density. Combining that with a stars<strong> spectral signature</strong>, the peculiarities of the light it radiates, we’ve been able to learn a lot about the composition of stars twinkling from afar.</p>
<p>With improvements in both our telescopes and our understanding we’ve been able to determine that approximately 85 % of the stars in our own neighbourhood, the <strong>Milky Way galaxy</strong>, are binary pairs, or even larger multiple star systems. It seems our Sun is the odd one out, all by its lonesome.</p>
<p>Be nice to our Sun. After all, we’re made of the same stuff.</p>

<p>I was talking with an amateur astronomer this morning who, in reference to another astronomer and blogger I mentioned, said <em>“He’s great… except that he believes in black holes.”</em></p>
<p>The comment caught me off guard. Up until that moment I had no idea that <strong>“black holes”</strong> was a topic of controversy. I dug into research as soon as I got home.</p>
<p>A black hole is the name for a small body of matter floating in the cosmos that is incredibly dense. Like the entire sun being compressed into a ball the size of a city. It is black because the density creates such a strong gravitational field that light itself is pulled back into itself.</p>
<p>If light can’t get out, we can’t possibly see it to prove it exists. However, astronomers observe the outside affects of a black hole and determine, though they can’t point to it, exactly where the black hole must be.</p>
<p>Just like earth and our neighboring planets orbit around the sun (being the most dense, and thus our gravity boss), astronomers can see stars orbiting around a spot in space. Something must be there at the center creating the orbit, and the best guess is that the something is a black hole.</p>
<p>Another way to spot a black hole is from bursts of <strong>x-rays</strong>. As a star gets too close to a black hole it begins moving faster and faster, heating up in the process. When the gas of the star reaches such temperatures it begins to emit x-rays. Eventually, as the star spirals ever closer to the black hole it too will become invisible, but outside of the <strong>“horizon”</strong> of the black hole (the tipping point of the gravitational field, a point of no return) we can observe these strange happenings. The clues add up to the presence of a black hole.</p>
<p>Proving the existence of black holes seems to be a case of <em>“if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck…”</em>, which leaves room for doubt as to whether or not there is a big duck at the center of our galaxy. Let’s take a look at the other side of the argument.</p>
<p>The anti-black-hole debate centers on one sticky issue, <strong>“The Information Paradox”</strong>. All the details are well beyond my understanding, but it boils down to this. You’ve perhaps heard of the law of conservation of energy… energy cannot be created or destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another. (A car’s forward momentum, through the friction of the brake pads, turns to heat dispersed into the air, etc.)</p>
<p>Well, there is a theory of quantum physics that says there must be a conservation of information. The information in question is sort of like DNA for particles at the smallest level. If matter was to collapse into a black hole, unable to escape, this information would no longer be accessible to the universe. To theoretical physicists, that’s a big problem.</p>
<p>Some of the proposed solutions involve fancy words like <em>“11-dimensional supergravity”</em> and other string-theory brain-busters that are well beyond the scope of the LSNED blog. If you will allow me to over-summarize, conveniently avoiding 500 more words of clumsy explanation, the leading anti-black-hole theory (the Holographic principle) is essentially arguing that a black hole is a mirage of sorts. Rather than a true physical black hole that gobbles up matter never to be seen again, it is a cosmic illusion that just appears that way to our simple three-dimensional brains.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will revisit that another day.</p>

<p>Back about 2000 years ago, the Greek scientists were becoming fascinated with magnetism when they stumbled upon <strong>lodestones</strong>, a naturally occurring magnet.</p>
<p>Lodestone is a piece of <strong>magnetite</strong>, an iron oxide, which produces a strong <strong>magnetic field</strong>. Now, to be clear, not all magnetite is magnetic (it won’t stick to your fridge by itself) but being a type of iron, all magnetite is attracted to a magnet (technical word: it’s <strong>ferrimagnetic</strong>).</p>
<p>The creation of a lodestone (magnetized magnetite) is still a bit of a mystery, but the leading hypothesis is that the magnetic properties were picked up after being struck by lightning. It’s sort of a geological superhero origin story. This theory is supported by the fact that a lodestone has never been found very far from earth’s surface.</p>
<p>The word magnet originates from <strong>Magnesia</strong>, which was a region of Greece where these original lodestones were popping up.</p>
<p>Magnetite lodestones are one of only two minerals that have been found to be naturally magnetized on earth. Which begs the question; how do the real estate agents and plumbers manage to get their hands on so many lodestones?</p>
<p>Most of the magnets we encounter on a daily basis have been artificially magnetized. You can start with any <strong>ferromagnetic</strong> material. (most commonly <strong>ferrite</strong>, a ceramic compound containing <strong>iron oxides</strong>) The simplest way to turn that into a magnet would be to rub it against something that is already magnetized in the same direction many times. (it’s sort of like you are “combing” the electrons)</p>
<p>To manufacture the strongest magnets, the material must be heated above the <strong>Curie temperature</strong>, which varies depending on the material, putting it into a receptive state. It’s then subjected to a strong electromagnetic field. As it cools, the magnetism remains in the material. If it’s ever re-heated past that Curie temperature again, it could lose it’s magnetic strength. I learned this the hard way when trying to use a hot glue gun on rare-earth magnets.</p>
<p>Now, this is just the tip of the iceberg for the fascinating science behind magnets. There is a lot to think about next time you go to clip up your grocery list.</p>

<p>A plane zips across the sky, leaving in its wake a long line of white cloud. There is a conspiracy theory that swears this is the government spraying the world with <em>“mind-control agents”</em> for nefarious means. A little bit of science reveals the truth.</p>
<p>The white line, called a <strong>condensation trail</strong>, or <strong>contrail</strong>, is made of nothing but cloud. They are no different than any other cloud in the sky. Just tiny droplets of water that float through the air. These contrails are created behind a jet plane as it literally rips through the sky.</p>
<p>The exhaust from a jet engine spews out a lot of hot air, along with water vapour, soot, and a few other chemicals. As the body and wing of the plane move through the air it creates a lot of <strong>turbulence</strong> in its wake, like a speedboat moving across a calm lake. As a result the cold air in the upper sky is violently churned with the engine exhaust. It’s this mix that often provides the right environment for clouds to form.</p>
<p>The cold air in the sky causes the warm <strong>water vapour</strong> to condense into droplets around the tiny particles of soot. If the air around the contrail is dry, it can suck up the moisture like a sponge fairly quickly, and the trail fades away. However, if the air is humid the contrail can be seen as a sharp line across the sky for hours as it slowly spreads out.</p>
<p>It’s actually the exact same process, though on a larger scale, as when you exhale on a clod day and can see your breath. That’s the warm humid air from your lungs condensing as it meets with the chilled outside air.</p>
<p>So that trail is not brain-numbing chemicals. It’s not smoke, or even pollution of any sort really. (Any jet exhaust seems insignificant compared to the number of cars on the road) It’s nothing but a harmless fluffy cloud. Although, there have been some studies asking questions about whether the additional blanket of clouds may be warming up our world.</p>
<p>Questions are good. Questions can be dangerous! Questions can sometimes make governments <em>wish</em> they were spraying mind-altering cocktails in the air.</p>

<p>Alas, it has been a while since I’ve written a new<strong> LSNED</strong> article. There are only 24 hours in a day, you know!</p>
<p>Twenty-four seems like an arbitrary number to choose for hours in a day. Consider that somebody along the way had to decide how long an hour was, and how many could squeeze into one day. So just where did the number come from?</p>
<p>It appears the Egyptians are the architects of our daily scheduling. In ancient times, their numbering system was based on 12, just as ours is based on 10. It is believed they learned to count using the joints of their fingers (three on each finger) making 12 the natural sized group. Frankly, that’s no more strange than how we now base everything on 10 because we have ten fingers/thumbs.</p>
<p>Any way you count it, the Egyptians loved their twelves, so they opted to decree there were twelve parts to the day, and twelve parts to the night. For a long time, these twelve parts would stretch and grow throughout the year as sunlight varies with the seasons. It was the Greek mathematician, <strong>Hipparchus</strong>, who first set about trying to standardize the time periods, but this was not widely practiced until the 4th century.</p>
<p>The word <em><strong>hour</strong></em> began as <em>hore</em> or <em>hora</em>, but the <em>H</em> has fallen silent since early Roman times.</p>
<p>If you’re hoping for more LSNED’s, I suggest you poke back into the archives with this article on clocks that let you smell the time. And next time you complain about not having enough hours in the day, at least know you know who to point your triple-jointed finger at. Yes indeed, we all… <em>clock like an Egyptian.</em></p>
