<p>Back about 2000 years ago, the Greek scientists were becoming fascinated with magnetism when they stumbled upon <strong>lodestones</strong>, a naturally occurring magnet.</p>
<p>Lodestone is a piece of <strong>magnetite</strong>, an iron oxide, which produces a strong <strong>magnetic field</strong>. Now, to be clear, not all magnetite is magnetic (it won’t stick to your fridge by itself) but being a type of iron, all magnetite is attracted to a magnet (technical word: it’s <strong>ferrimagnetic</strong>).</p>
<p>The creation of a lodestone (magnetized magnetite) is still a bit of a mystery, but the leading hypothesis is that the magnetic properties were picked up after being struck by lightning. It’s sort of a geological superhero origin story. This theory is supported by the fact that a lodestone has never been found very far from earth’s surface.</p>
<p>The word magnet originates from <strong>Magnesia</strong>, which was a region of Greece where these original lodestones were popping up.</p>
<p>Magnetite lodestones are one of only two minerals that have been found to be naturally magnetized on earth. Which begs the question; how do the real estate agents and plumbers manage to get their hands on so many lodestones?</p>
<p>Most of the magnets we encounter on a daily basis have been artificially magnetized. You can start with any <strong>ferromagnetic</strong> material. (most commonly <strong>ferrite</strong>, a ceramic compound containing <strong>iron oxides</strong>) The simplest way to turn that into a magnet would be to rub it against something that is already magnetized in the same direction many times. (it’s sort of like you are “combing” the electrons)</p>
<p>To manufacture the strongest magnets, the material must be heated above the <strong>Curie temperature</strong>, which varies depending on the material, putting it into a receptive state. It’s then subjected to a strong electromagnetic field. As it cools, the magnetism remains in the material. If it’s ever re-heated past that Curie temperature again, it could lose it’s magnetic strength. I learned this the hard way when trying to use a hot glue gun on rare-earth magnets.</p>
<p>Now, this is just the tip of the iceberg for the fascinating science behind magnets. There is a lot to think about next time you go to clip up your grocery list.</p>

<p>A plane zips across the sky, leaving in its wake a long line of white cloud. There is a conspiracy theory that swears this is the government spraying the world with <em>“mind-control agents”</em> for nefarious means. A little bit of science reveals the truth.</p>
<p>The white line, called a <strong>condensation trail</strong>, or <strong>contrail</strong>, is made of nothing but cloud. They are no different than any other cloud in the sky. Just tiny droplets of water that float through the air. These contrails are created behind a jet plane as it literally rips through the sky.</p>
<p>The exhaust from a jet engine spews out a lot of hot air, along with water vapour, soot, and a few other chemicals. As the body and wing of the plane move through the air it creates a lot of <strong>turbulence</strong> in its wake, like a speedboat moving across a calm lake. As a result the cold air in the upper sky is violently churned with the engine exhaust. It’s this mix that often provides the right environment for clouds to form.</p>
<p>The cold air in the sky causes the warm <strong>water vapour</strong> to condense into droplets around the tiny particles of soot. If the air around the contrail is dry, it can suck up the moisture like a sponge fairly quickly, and the trail fades away. However, if the air is humid the contrail can be seen as a sharp line across the sky for hours as it slowly spreads out.</p>
<p>It’s actually the exact same process, though on a larger scale, as when you exhale on a clod day and can see your breath. That’s the warm humid air from your lungs condensing as it meets with the chilled outside air.</p>
<p>So that trail is not brain-numbing chemicals. It’s not smoke, or even pollution of any sort really. (Any jet exhaust seems insignificant compared to the number of cars on the road) It’s nothing but a harmless fluffy cloud. Although, there have been some studies asking questions about whether the additional blanket of clouds may be warming up our world.</p>
<p>Questions are good. Questions can be dangerous! Questions can sometimes make governments <em>wish</em> they were spraying mind-altering cocktails in the air.</p>

<p>Alas, it has been a while since I’ve written a new<strong> LSNED</strong> article. There are only 24 hours in a day, you know!</p>
<p>Twenty-four seems like an arbitrary number to choose for hours in a day. Consider that somebody along the way had to decide how long an hour was, and how many could squeeze into one day. So just where did the number come from?</p>
<p>It appears the Egyptians are the architects of our daily scheduling. In ancient times, their numbering system was based on 12, just as ours is based on 10. It is believed they learned to count using the joints of their fingers (three on each finger) making 12 the natural sized group. Frankly, that’s no more strange than how we now base everything on 10 because we have ten fingers/thumbs.</p>
<p>Any way you count it, the Egyptians loved their twelves, so they opted to decree there were twelve parts to the day, and twelve parts to the night. For a long time, these twelve parts would stretch and grow throughout the year as sunlight varies with the seasons. It was the Greek mathematician, <strong>Hipparchus</strong>, who first set about trying to standardize the time periods, but this was not widely practiced until the 4th century.</p>
<p>The word <em><strong>hour</strong></em> began as <em>hore</em> or <em>hora</em>, but the <em>H</em> has fallen silent since early Roman times.</p>
<p>If you’re hoping for more LSNED’s, I suggest you poke back into the archives with this article on clocks that let you smell the time. And next time you complain about not having enough hours in the day, at least know you know who to point your triple-jointed finger at. Yes indeed, we all… <em>clock like an Egyptian.</em></p>

<p>There is a lot of hub-bub about a <strong>neutrino</strong> that was witnessed moving faster than the speed of light, a feat which was deemed impossible by <strong>Albert Einstein’s</strong> theory of relativity. The science community is working overtime to figure out if the experiment can be repeated and confirmed, as it would have a major impact on our understanding of physics.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing some reading to get a better grasp of what, exactly, a neutrino really is. It is a rather elusive particle, which adds an air of mystery (not to mention difficulty) to any observation experiments.</p>
<p>One thing I do know is that, at this very second, billions of neutrinos are passing straight through your body without even slowing down.</p>
<p>The existence of the tiny neutrino particle was proposed as a solution to some “missing energy” observed in radioactive decay. It was theorized that some sort of particle was carrying this energy away. Shortly thereafter <strong>Enrico Fermi</strong> worked out the specific role that the mystery particle needed to fill, dubbing it the neutrino due to it having no electromagnetic charge… the particle was neutral.</p>
<p>The fact that it is neither negatively or positively charged is what makes it so hard to detect. It has so little interaction with other particles that it can zip right through objects without stopping, slowing, or changing direction. All the neutrinos that are generated from our sun not only pass through your body, but right through the core of the earth and out the other side on their journey across the universe.</p>
<p>That’s the trouble. If they pass through the solid granite of the earth without a second thought, how can our scientists “capture” neutrinos in any sort of observation equipment? Studying neutrinos is a bit like trying to spot bigfoot… if bigfoot was also invisible and moving about the speed of light. All they have to go on is the footprints and broken branches left behind.</p>
<p>The original experiment that caught a glimpse of neutrinos occured in 1956. There was a big water tank. While the vast majority of neutrinos pass through silently, due to sheer volume they would sometimes collide and interact with <strong>protons</strong> in the water. This would create <strong>positrons</strong>, which would in turn create a pair of <strong>gamma rays</strong> if it collided with an <strong>electron</strong>. The gamma rays excited a <strong>scintillator</strong>, which is  a material that absorbs gamma rays and emits light. Finally, the tiny flashes of light were recorded by sensors inside the tank.</p>
<p>It was a Rube Goldberg machine on the atomic scale, but it worked. The experiments recorded about three light flashes per hour. More intricate, modern experiments can not only catch the existence of neutrinos, but capture information about the direction and speed of travel. The largest neutrino-catcher actually uses the solid ice of Antarctica as its water tank. Through this we are able to see evidence of cosmic explosions and supernovas far beyond the range of our telescopes.</p>
<p>The complexity required to observe neutrinos is why physicists are being extremely cautious about this new “faster than light” hypothesis.</p>
<p>Does this really explain what a neutrino is? Perhaps I should just leave it at the description by <strong>Frederick Reines</strong>, telling us that a neutrino is <em>“the most tiny quantity of reality ever imagined by a human being.”</em></p>

<p>The brightest star that we can see in the night sky has been named <strong>Sirius</strong>, an ancient Greek word for <em>“glowing”</em>. It’s one of the closest stars to earth, about <strong>8.5 light years</strong> away, and we can look forward to it getting brighter for the next 60,000 years as it inches ever closer to us. When the conditions are right, this star can be seen even in daylight.</p>
<p>It was in 1844, however, when this bright pinpoint of light was determined to be a <strong>binary star</strong>. That means the light we see is, in fact, produced by a pair of burning gas balls so close together that it seems as one. <strong>Sirius A</strong> is a big bright star, while <strong>Sirius B</strong> is a tiny <strong>white dwarf</strong>, which is a late stage star that has nearly burnt out and collapsed into a super dense ball. A teaspoon of white dwarf star material would weigh about the same as a locomotive.</p>
<p>The two make up a binary star system because they orbit around each other at about the same distance as <strong>Uranus</strong> orbits around the <strong>Sun</strong>. That’s close enough to be tangled up in each others gravitational fields. Some binary stars are so close that they actually pull on the gas like the moon pulls on the ocean tides. Matter is ripped free of it’s gravitational bonds creating a stream of “star juice” between the two masses.</p>
<p>Thanks to <strong>Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion</strong> physicists have been able to look at the orbits of binary stars, which from our viewpoint is little more than a wobble, and reverse engineer the precise details of their mass and density. Combining that with a stars<strong> spectral signature</strong>, the peculiarities of the light it radiates, we’ve been able to learn a lot about the composition of stars twinkling from afar.</p>
<p>With improvements in both our telescopes and our understanding we’ve been able to determine that approximately 85 % of the stars in our own neighbourhood, the <strong>Milky Way galaxy</strong>, are binary pairs, or even larger multiple star systems. It seems our Sun is the odd one out, all by its lonesome.</p>
<p>Be nice to our Sun. After all, we’re made of the same stuff.</p>

<p>I was talking with an amateur astronomer this morning who, in reference to another astronomer and blogger I mentioned, said <em>“He’s great… except that he believes in black holes.”</em></p>
<p>The comment caught me off guard. Up until that moment I had no idea that <strong>“black holes”</strong> was a topic of controversy. I dug into research as soon as I got home.</p>
<p>A black hole is the name for a small body of matter floating in the cosmos that is incredibly dense. Like the entire sun being compressed into a ball the size of a city. It is black because the density creates such a strong gravitational field that light itself is pulled back into itself.</p>
<p>If light can’t get out, we can’t possibly see it to prove it exists. However, astronomers observe the outside affects of a black hole and determine, though they can’t point to it, exactly where the black hole must be.</p>
<p>Just like earth and our neighboring planets orbit around the sun (being the most dense, and thus our gravity boss), astronomers can see stars orbiting around a spot in space. Something must be there at the center creating the orbit, and the best guess is that the something is a black hole.</p>
<p>Another way to spot a black hole is from bursts of <strong>x-rays</strong>. As a star gets too close to a black hole it begins moving faster and faster, heating up in the process. When the gas of the star reaches such temperatures it begins to emit x-rays. Eventually, as the star spirals ever closer to the black hole it too will become invisible, but outside of the <strong>“horizon”</strong> of the black hole (the tipping point of the gravitational field, a point of no return) we can observe these strange happenings. The clues add up to the presence of a black hole.</p>
<p>Proving the existence of black holes seems to be a case of <em>“if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck…”</em>, which leaves room for doubt as to whether or not there is a big duck at the center of our galaxy. Let’s take a look at the other side of the argument.</p>
<p>The anti-black-hole debate centers on one sticky issue, <strong>“The Information Paradox”</strong>. All the details are well beyond my understanding, but it boils down to this. You’ve perhaps heard of the law of conservation of energy… energy cannot be created or destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another. (A car’s forward momentum, through the friction of the brake pads, turns to heat dispersed into the air, etc.)</p>
<p>Well, there is a theory of quantum physics that says there must be a conservation of information. The information in question is sort of like DNA for particles at the smallest level. If matter was to collapse into a black hole, unable to escape, this information would no longer be accessible to the universe. To theoretical physicists, that’s a big problem.</p>
<p>Some of the proposed solutions involve fancy words like <em>“11-dimensional supergravity”</em> and other string-theory brain-busters that are well beyond the scope of the LSNED blog. If you will allow me to over-summarize, conveniently avoiding 500 more words of clumsy explanation, the leading anti-black-hole theory (the Holographic principle) is essentially arguing that a black hole is a mirage of sorts. Rather than a true physical black hole that gobbles up matter never to be seen again, it is a cosmic illusion that just appears that way to our simple three-dimensional brains.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will revisit that another day.</p>
